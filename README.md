# EthAlgorithmicTradingModel1
The model is imcomplete but if you can get a csv file with columns 'Open', 'Close', 'High', 'Low', and 'Volume', you can use that file and put it through datapreparer.ipynb which will add a lot of extra columns that run many algebraic calculations and uses calculations such as standard moving average, volume oscillators, and many other calculations.
When plugging into the mlbotcalculator, you may get unique results which may have different accuracies when used in different intervals but you can always test with calculations.xlsx and plug and chug different values to try.

THE PROJECT IS INCOMPLETE BUT SEMI WORKS
